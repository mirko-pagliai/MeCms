<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you
    browse the internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits
    of information about your activities across websites, including our site.
    They also allow us to remember things about your visit our site, such as
    your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the
    site easier for you to use.

    We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is
    used to identify a particular visit to our site. These cookies expire
    after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using our
    services. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing
    session, such as when you log into our site. A persistent cookie will
    remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie.
    We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period
    of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that
    we keep you signed in.
